In this project I have divided my project into 4 section 
index.html file
welcome.html file
Login.java
Logout.java

in the index.html file I am creating the form in which I will put EmailId and Password and the particular data it will pass
in Login.java file, there it will get matched with the hardcoded data which I have provided once it confirm that the
particular data is correct it will go on welcome.html file, and there it will show the Successful login. 

And in that particular html page I will provide the logout java file link which will show that you are successfully once
we click on the Logout button.
